# MySQL. Versions 5.5.8 and up are supported.
#
# Install the MySQL driver
#   gem install mysql2
#
# Ensure the MySQL gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'mysql2'
#
# # And be sure to use new-style password hashing:
# #   https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/password-hashing.html

# # Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# # re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# # Do not set this db to the same as development or production.

# # As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# # like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# # ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
# #
# # Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# # variable when you boot the app. For example:
# #
# #   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
# #
# # If the connection URL is provided in the special DATABASE_URL environment
# # variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
# # the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
# # URL environment variable explicitly:
# #
# #   production:
# #     url: <%= ENV['MY_APP_DATABASE_URL'] %>
# #
# # Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# # for a full overview on how database connection configuration can be specified.
# #
# production:
#   <<: *default
#   database: rubyoverview_production
#   username: rubyoverview
#   password: <%= ENV['RUBYOVERVIEW_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>

# PostgreSQL. Versions 9.3 and up are supported.
#
# Install the pg driver:
#   gem install pg
# On macOS with Homebrew:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/usr/local/bin/pg_config
# On macOS with MacPorts:
#   gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/opt/local/lib/postgresql84/bin/pg_config
# On Windows:
#   gem install pg
#       Choose the win32 build.
#       Install PostgreSQL and put its /bin directory on your path.
#
# Configure Using Gemfile
# gem 'pg'
